##### Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008? #####


##### How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City? #####


##### Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions #####
# from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"\color{red}{\verb|fips == "06037"|}fips=="06037").
# Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?


##### For each plot you should #####

# Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
# Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot.
#Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
#You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
#Only include the code for a single plot (i.e. plot1.R should only include code for producing plot1.png)
# Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
# Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.
